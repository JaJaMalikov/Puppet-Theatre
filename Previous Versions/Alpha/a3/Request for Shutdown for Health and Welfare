Request for Shutdown for Health and Welfare

We the workers of Bar Deco, and affiliated companies, do request that the companies under Rex Management be closed for the current COVID-19 pandemic until such a time that reasonable consideration for the health and safety for workers can be assured. As the Center for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the District update their requirements for businesses and restaurants, it is becoming increasingly apparent that remaining open in the current situation is unsafe and irresponsible, not only to our patrons but to our staff as well.
As of today (March 15, 2020), the COVID-19 mandatory requirements put out by the District, the only floor meeting the requirements would be 2nd Floor. Many of the tables would need to be removed and antibacterial sprays for disinfecting tables between patrons would need to be procured when the public is already in short supply. This decrease in capacity and our typical volume of weekday patrons in mind, the payout for staying open simply does not meet the risk imposed to Bar Deco employees, their families or the public itself. 
The DC Metro area has already had evidence of community spread in addition to over 100 confirmed cases. It is our responsibility to limit transmission as much as possible while the virus continues to spread. Attached below are the CDC recommendations for commercial businesses (Page 3) and workplaces, much of which Bar Decoâ€™s antiquated POS system, staffing procedures and bar practices are not conducive to meeting at this time:
