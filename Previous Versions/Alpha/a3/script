Hello my children
I am Rethgual the undying
A vampiric necromancer with years of experiance working with the arcane
This is suppose to be a basic test of my lip syncing and composition of all well drawn components, animated props, and captions
however
I live in Washington DC and my job just shut down for public health and safety so I'm going to spend the next however long working on my animation.
so I'm going to put out more videos over the next few weeks and maybe perfect my software cause I'd love to be able to tell the stories I've always wanted to tell and I need something to distract me from this pandemic

remember to keep yourselves safe and clean friends
not just for you
but for everyone around you who might not survive this disease
I'll see you next time, don't forget to subscribe, and hit the bell icon to get alerts on my future animations
