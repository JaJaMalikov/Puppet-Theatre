script:
	res used:
		link, pos, default scale

object profile:
	# of sheets
	# of rows per sheet
	# of frames per row
	composition style (none, color keyed)
		layers composited
			color per layer
	scale with distance on/off
	animation on/off
	icon: None or "name"

whenever I create an object I write the object file first and edit it as I go


open "script":
	for line in script.readlines():
		line.split(":"):
			if line[0] is "title":
				self.title = line[0]
			if line[0] is "entity":
				enttiies.append(load(line[1]))


camera = {data:{x_pos, y_pos, scale,} recording:[], playback:bool}

stage should have a fade and title card function
perhaps using an image listed in the script

use "stage left" and "stage right" consistantly (dammit >:C)

key commands:
	1: back one entity
	2: advance one entity
	arrow keys: move left and right, stage front, stage back
	[: move up
	]: move down
	-: rotate left
	=: rotate right
	p: shake



discrete vs continous movement
	toggle
	discrete movement: set range x scale x dir
