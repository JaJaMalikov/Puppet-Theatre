versions:

	2[x]: character talking in front of a chalkboard/slideshow
		can simply enlarge slideshow to be whole image
	3[x]: characters walking around on background, background scolls and is arbitrarily large, camera can follow but not record
	4: background scales and can be layered to make a prop effect, animated backgrounds, props = backgrounds? multiple cams, can 	be recorded
	5: ?


rant - 1, maybe more characters, foreground character is
			full animation, lip-synced

stage- 10 characters + props, smooth animation, spritesheets
